I am interested in seeing immediate feedback for problem resolution.  Having a complaint window has proven useless.  Over the years no feedback or resolution has ever been the result from such an effort.  I am specifically interested in the inability of apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and so forth that seemingly have no contactable support.  Even with the paid Microsoft packages.
